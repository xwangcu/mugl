Acknowledgement:
We reuse some code by Prof. Xiaowen Dong (http://web.media.mit.edu/~xdong/code/graphlearning.zip) and in the GSP Toolbox (https://epfl-lts2.github.io/gspbox-html/doc/demos/gsp_demo_learn_graph_large.html).

Usage:
To use the graph_learning_gaussian_dong.m function, you need to have CVX (http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/, you can get a free academic license if you have an academic affiliation) and SWGT (http://wiki.epfl.ch/sgwt) toolboxes installed. Once you have installed CVX, you should first run cvx_setup.m first and then you can run the main functions.
